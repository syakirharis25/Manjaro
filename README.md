## 1. Introduction.
<img src="manjaro.png" height="100"> 
Manjaro is a free and open-source Linux distribution based on the Arch Linux operating system. Manjaro has a focus on user friendliness and accessibility, and the system itself is designed to work fully "straight out of the box" with its variety of pre-installed software. It features a rolling release update model and uses Pacman as its package manager. Developed in Austria, France, and Germany, Manjaro provides all the benefits of the Arch operating system combined with a focus on user-friendliness and accessibility. Manjaro follow Archlinux and officially only offers a 64 bit version. 
<br /><br />
Manjaro is based on Arch Linux and has its own collection of repositories. The distribution aims to be user-friendly while maintaining the Arch base, most notably the Pacman package manager and compatibility with the Arch User Repositories (AUR). Manjaro uses three sets of repositories: The unstable repositories contain the most bleeding edge Arch packages, possibly one or two days delayed; the testing repositories contain packages from the unstable repositories synchronized every week, which provides an initial screening; and the stable repositories contain only packages that are deemed stable by the development team.
<br /><br />
Manjaro repositories are managed with their own tool called BoxIt, which is designed like Git. Manjaro includes its own GUI settings manager where options like language, drivers, and kernel version can be simply configured. Certain commonly used Arch utilities such as the Arch Build System (ABS) are available but have alternate implementations in Manjaro. Manjaro Architect is a CLI net installer which allows the user to choose their own kernel version, drivers and desktop environment during the install process. Both the official and the community edition's desktop environments are available for selection.
